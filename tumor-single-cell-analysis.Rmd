## Introduction

Here, I provide a step by step analysis of the publicly available single cell RNA-sequencing dataset from Ishizuka et al. 2019, using the R package Seurat.

This analysis is meant to serve as an example of how to analyze single cell RNA-sequencing data generated using hte 10X Genomics platform using the R package Seurat. I provide details for each step so that researchers with only basic techniques in R will be able to analyze data of this type. I hope that this will help those whoa re planning to perform their own experiment in the future.

## Load packages

```{r}
library(Seurat)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Read in the Data

```{r}
raw_data <- Read10X("haining")
```

Once the raw data is read in, you can create a Seurat object using CreateSeuratObject()
